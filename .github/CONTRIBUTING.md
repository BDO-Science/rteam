# How to Contribute a Cheatsheet

## Contribute a New Cheatsheet

Want to contribute a cheatsheet of your own?

Weâ€™d like to help you make and share high quality cheatsheets on R topics. The template below provides a useful starting place. It contains tips for designing a three or four column cheatsheet, as well as reusable elements to build your sheet with. Check out the [README](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/README.md) for more tips on making good cheatsheets.

If you make a cheatsheet, we encourage you to share it here with us! We accept and post cheatsheets on a volunteer basis. Each cheatsheet must be licensed under the [creative commons 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and be attributed to you, the author. Include "CC-BY-SA Your Name" somewhere on the cheatsheet.

To submit a finished cheatsheet, open a pull request!

We ask you include:  
* A PDF file of your cheatsheet
* A .png image of the first page of your cheatsheet 1100 x 850 (for the website thumbnail)
* The original Keynote, PowerPoint, or similar file if possible (for translators)

Cheatsheet pull requests and issues tend be handled in bursts, and we may wait for several to accumulate before sorting through them so don't worry if your submission sits for a while!


## Translate a Cheatsheet

To submit a translation of a cheatsheet, open a pull request!

We ask that you include:
* A PDF file of your cheatsheet, include the language in the file name
* Your translated Keynote or PowerPoint file

Cheatsheet pull requests and issues tend be handled in bursts, and we may wait for several to accumulate before sorting through them so don't worry if your submission sits for a while!

## HTML cheatsheets

If you wish to provide an HTML cheatsheet version, please create a Pull Request 
with a new `.qmd` file in the `html/` directory of this repository. Use one of 
the existing `qmd` files there as a starting point/template. These should not be duplicates of the pdf versions - they should be text-based so they are more accessible
to people with visual impairments. Use of images should be minimized, and any images should include appropriate alternative text.
